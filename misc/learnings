The memfd_create function returns a file descriptor which can be used to create memory mappings using the mmap function. It is similar to the shm_open function in the sense that these mappings are not backed by actual files. However, the descriptor returned by memfd_create does not correspond to a named object; the name argument is used for debugging purposes only (e.g., will appear in /proc), and separate invocations of memfd_create with the same name will not return descriptors for the same region of memory. The descriptor can also be used to create alias mappings within the same process.

The descriptor initially refers to a zero-length file. Before mappings can be created which are backed by memory, the file size needs to be increased with the ftruncate function
